  <p>How do I upload an image of a product?
To upload an image, simply click the [upload button] or drag and drop the image file. Make sure the product photo is clear and focused for better results.
    <br> 
How can I find similar products to the one in my image?
The platform will suggest similar products based on the design, color, and other visible features. These results are filtered according to the product category, style, and popularity.
<br>
What types of images give better results?
The best results come from clear, well-lit photos that focus on the entire product and the product has to be in the middle of the photo 
<br>
I didn’t get the correct results from my image. What should I do?
If the results aren’t accurate, try uploading a different image from another angle, or upload a higher-quality photo. You can also try adding more images that focus on the key features of the product</p>
